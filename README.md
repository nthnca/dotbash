# dotbash

This repository contains my basic environment setup. It contains a number of
different configuration tweaks that I have built up over the years. Hopefully
it is organized in a way that is easy to understand and easy to modify for your
own uses if you so wish.

## Install

- 'git clone https://github.com/nathanbullock/dotbash.git'
- 'cp dotbash/example.bashrc ~/.bashrc'
- 'ln ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile'

At this point open .bashrc and tweak any variables referred to there.
